# Project Abstract #

Search engines have advanced quite a bit since the mid-nineties. Improvements in algorithms, scale of operations and personalization have made search engines indispensible while browsing the web. However, most search engines are still heavily focused on retrieval based on textual queries. None of the mainstream search engines support other types of multimedia queries (e.g. given an image, find all similar images), though smaller players have innovated in these areas. We have designed and implemented a large-scale audio search engine called Bonnie Longears. A user provides a short (potentially noisy) sample through a web interface and our search engine returns a ranked list of names of songs which match the query. Our indexing algorithm is robust and ensures that meaningful results are returned even in the presence of noise in the query provided. The indexing process itself is done in a distributed environment (using Hadoop) and runs on multiple machines (if available) simultaneously. Searching is also distributed across multiple machines with a search client querying many search slaves in parallel and each slave holding a part of the index in memory. If the source of songs and other music files is a single machine and the index is queried from the same machine (similar to Google Desktop), the returned results can be played and previewed from the web-interface itself.
